      <h4>Guerrila Open Access Manifesto</h4>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for
           themselves. The world's entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries
            in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private 
            corporations. Want to read the papers featuring the most famous results of the sciences?
           You'll need to send enormous amounts to publishers like Reed Elsevier.</li>
        <br>
        <li>There are those struggling to change this. The Open Access Movement has
           fought valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away 
           but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under terms that
            allow anyone to access it. But even under the best scenarios, their work will
             only apply to things published
           in the future. Everything up until now will have been lost.</li>
        <br>
        <li>That is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to
           read the work of their colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but 
           only allowing the folks at Google to read them? Providing scientific 
           articles to those at elite universities in the First World, but not to children
           in the Global South? It's outrageous and unacceptable.</li>
        <br>
        <li>"I agree," many say, "but what can we do? The companies hold the copyrights,
           they make enormous amounts of money by charging for access, and it's perfectly
            legal — there's nothing we can do to stop them." But there is something 
          we can, something that's already being done: we can fight back.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Those with access to these resources — students, librarians,
           scientists — you have been given a privilege. You get to feed at this
            banquet of knowledge while the rest of the world is locked out.
             But you need not — indeed, morally, you cannot — keep this privilege for
              yourselves. You have a duty to share it with the world. And you have: trading 
          passwords with colleagues, filling download requests for friends.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Meanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by.
           You have been sneaking through holes and climbing over fences,
            liberating the information
           locked up by the publishers and sharing them with your friends.</li>
        <br>
        <li>But all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground. 
          It's called stealing or piracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge 
          were the moral equivalent of plundering a ship and murdering its crew.
           But sharing isn't immoral — it's a moral imperative. Only those blinded 
           by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Large corporations, of course, are blinded by greed. The laws under 
          which they operate require it — their shareholders would revolt at anything less. 
          And the politicians they have bought off back them, passing
           laws giving them the exclusive power to decide who can make copies.</li>
        <br>
        <li>There is no justice in following unjust laws. It's time to come
           into the light and, in the grand tradition of civil disobedience,
           declare our opposition to this private theft of public culture.</li>
        <br>
        <li>We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies
           and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that's out of
            copyright and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret databases 
            and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to 
          file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open Access.</li>
        <br>
        <li>With enough of us, around the world, we'll not just send a strong message
           opposing the privatization
           of knowledge — we'll make it a thing of the past. Will you join us?</li>
